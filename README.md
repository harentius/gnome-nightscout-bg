Installation
============

```
cd $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
git clone git@github.com:harentius/gnome-nightscout-bg.git
or
https://github.com/harentius/gnome-nightscout-bg.git
```

Inspired by: https://github.com/ImmRanneft/nightscout-spice (Cinnamon version)

**Attention: Highly experimental project for my own purposes. It doesn't have a UI for configuration. All configuration is at the top of extension.js file.
Use it at your own risk.**
