Gnome Shell extension applet for displaying blood glucose levels from the Nightscout project.

## Installation

```
cd $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
git clone https://github.com/harentius/gnome-nightscout-bg.git
```

Inspired by: https://github.com/ImmRanneft/nightscout-spice (Cinnamon version)

## Disclaimer
Highly experimental project for personal use.  
It lacks a user interface for configuration; all settings are located at the top of the extension.js file.  
Use it at your own risk.
